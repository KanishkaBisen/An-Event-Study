Event Study on EV & Supplier Stocks

This project conducts an event study analysis on Electric Vehicle (EV) companies (Tesla, BYD, NIO, Rivian, Lucid) and their supplier networks (CATL, Panasonic, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, Rio Tinto, Gotion).

The objective is to measure the impact of policy, subsidy, and tariff announcements on stock returns and to quantify spillover effects from EV firms to their suppliers.
